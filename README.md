## Instructions

* This is an old school frogger arcade game that you can start [here](C:\Users\C.Blake\Desktop\Developer Folder\Front-End Nanodegree\Old School Arcade Game\index.html).
* The goal is to navigate through the horde of insects and reach the water to escape.
* When the water is reached the game will be over and replayable once again.
* If the character collides with any of the insects the game will reset from the start position.


### Movement

- use the up, down, left, right arrow keys to navigate the canvas with your avatar.

## Resources
Some of the resources used to build the game:
* jQuery
* Google fonts
* vanilla JS and css

### Note
I've written comments throughout the code to help readers understand the function of each
code written. Please refer to the comments if any of the code gets confusing.
